                <p>Social media usage continues to grow across the world, and China is no exception. With an Internet user population of 650 million (nearly twice the population of the entire U.S.) and censorship laws that prohibit those consumers from participating in the social networks that dominate the rest of the world in popularity, China did the inevitable and created their own platforms and networks—with some, like Tencent Weibo, boasting user bases exceeding half a billion accounts (for comparison, consider that Facebook has around 1.3 billion users). However, although the Internet is an open place, entering the Chinese Internet world is not as easy as it sounds. Barriers can be seen everywhere, such as language, culture, government policies and most importantly, Internet users that usually think, interact and buy differently than the ones you know well.</p>
